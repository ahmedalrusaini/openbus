# openbus
**openbus** is a customer oriented application to support daily business. 

## Idea
No particular news behind it, there are several stable powerful CRM application already. 
So why a new one? So far I have no cool answer for this question except that I enjoy programming. 

Time ago I started a similar application based on Rails (awesome), but after falling in love with Angular and Node.js (super awesome) 
I decided to spend my nights developing a new application based on those frameworks.

## Requirements
As mentioned above, **openbus** is built upon [Angular](http://angularjs.org), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) (with [FontAwesome]() icons), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) 
and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) as the database.
